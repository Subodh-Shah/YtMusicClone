## ðŸ›  My First Tailwind CSS + JavaScript Project

Hey everyone! ðŸ‘‹
I started my coding journey just 2 months ago, and this is my very first project where Iâ€™ve applied Tailwind CSS and JavaScript. Iâ€™m really excited to share it with you all! ðŸš€

### ðŸŒŸ Project Overview
This project is a simple clone of YouTube Music that allowed me to practice the following:

Responsive design using Tailwind CSS
JavaScript to handle interactivity and UI behavior
Although I'm a complete beginner, Iâ€™ve learned a lot through building this and would love to hear your feedback on how I can improve moving forward! ðŸ˜Š

### âœ¨ Features
Responsive layout using Tailwind CSS utilities
Interactive capsules slider (I customized the Tailwind config file to remove the scrollbar for a cleaner look)
JavaScript functionality: Side menu toggle and hover effect on the play button

### ðŸ›  Technologies Used
Tailwind CSS for styling
JavaScript for interactive elements
Vite for local development and fast reloading

### ðŸ¤” Feedback & Suggestions
Since this is my first project and first time writing a README on GitHub, I would love any tips or advice on improving my project or even formatting my README better. Any suggestions will help me improve! ðŸ™Œ

### ðŸ“Œ Future Improvements
Add a music player feature
Implement playlists and recommendations section
Optimize performance and responsiveness across devices
